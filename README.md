Smart NFC-Based Attendance system for Mobile & Fixed Assets access
Project Abstract –
This project delivers an IoT-enabled, production-ready attendance and room-access device that authenticates users via NFC ID cards and securely streams real-time attendance events to a central server for analytics and role-based access decisions. Built on an STM32 with the X-NUCLEO-NFC09A1 and integrated Wi-Fi, the next phase covers custom PCB design and fabrication to consolidate the MCU, NFC front end, power management, and I/O into a compact, reliable module with a smaller footprint. Planned features include offline attendance caching with auto-resync, OTA firmware updates, ESD/EMI protections, service test points, and an optional front-panel display for live status and user feedback. The architecture leaves clear paths for future add-ons like cameras, electronic door actuation, and mobile alerts. The result is a scalable IoT product for campuses that reduces manual overhead, discourages proxy attendance, and is ready for pilot deployment and small-batch manufacturing.
